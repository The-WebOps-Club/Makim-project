	<p id="para">The Nobel Prize in Chemistry (Swedish: Nobelpriset i kemi) is awarded annually by the <i>Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences</i> to scientists in the various fields of chemistry. It is one of the five Nobel Prizes established by the 1895 will of Alfred Nobel, who died in 1896. These prizes are awarded for contributions in physics, literature, peace, and physiology or medicine.<img src="brain.jpg">As dictated by Nobel's will, the award is administered by the Nobel Foundation and awarded by a committee that consists of five members elected by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.[2] The first Nobel Prize in Chemistry was awarded in 1901 to Jacobus Henricus van 't Hoff, of the <b>Netherlands</b>. Each recipient receives a medal, a diploma and a monetary award prize that has varied throughout the years.[3] </p>
